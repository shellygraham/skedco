Add the ability to moderate and approve new topics and replies in the bbPress V2.0 plugin

To help reduce spam in bbPress forums, this plugin will change the status of new topics and
replies to 'pending'. Any pending topics/replies will be shown as 'Awaiting Moderation' until
the administrator approves publishes them.

**Features**

* Blog administrator can be notified of new topics and replies requiring moderation.
* Anonymous postings can always be marked for moderation.
* Registered users can post without moderation after the first topic/reply is approved.
* A bubble counter is shown on the Topics and Replies menu to indicate the number of posts awaiting moderation.
* Pending topics/replies are styled to give the submitting user a 'hint' that the new topic/reply is pending

**Languages**

* English
* French
* German - Thanks - daveshine (David Decker)
* Turkish - Thanks Mustafa Ã‡oban
* Spanish - Thanks Yo
* The .pot file is shipped for other translations - [send them in email iandstanley at gmail dot com]

== Installation ==

To install the plugin complete the following steps

1. Unzip the zip-file and upload the content to your Wordpress Plugin directory. Usually `/wp-content/plugins`
2. Activate the plugin via the Admin plugin page.

== Usage ==

Once activated the bbPressModeration plugin will, depending on the settings, prevent the publishing
of topics and replies until approved by the site administrator. 

Registered users who have previously had a topic/reply approved do not need to go through the moderation
process for subsequent posts.

If a topic/reply is marked for moderation then it is shown in the bbPress Topic or Reply menu as Pending.
To approve the post, edit and click Publish.
